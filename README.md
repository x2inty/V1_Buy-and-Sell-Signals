Thank you for using a virtual environment. 

This code fetches daily Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) data directly from the Binance API, then calculates several technical indicators to assess market conditions. It starts by computing 7-day and 14-day simple moving averages (SMA), the 14-day percentage change, and volatility over the same period. 

Next, it categorizes volatility into three groups (Stable, Volatile, Trending) based on its deviation from the mean. 

The trend is labeled as "Bullish" or "Bearish" depending on the position of the moving averages and is confirmed if it lasts at least three consecutive days. By combining these elements, the script generates buy or sell signals according to the trend, volatility level, and magnitude of the price change. The signals are classified by strength and market type, and the results from March 2025 onward are displayed for analysis.

For a simple and readable strategy, this is a good foundation. In this code, buy and sell signals are generated based solely on the following conditions:

1_ SMA (Simple Moving Average) trend: If the 7-day SMA was greater than the 14-day SMA, the trend was bullish, otherwise, it was bearish.

2_ Volatility: Volatility was classified into three categories: Stable, Volatile, and Trending.

3_ 14-day change (14-day_chg): This condition evaluates the price change over the last 14 days, and depending on the magnitude of this change, different types of buy or sell signals are generated ("Sell - Volatile (Strong)" or "Buy - Stable").

In a new code, we could add multiple additional layers of analysis to improve signal reliability by incorporating technical indicators such as RSI and MACD, along with confidence levels for signals ("Low confidence," "RSI/MACD Confirmed," or "Weak confidence").
